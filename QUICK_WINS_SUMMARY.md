## 🎯 **How to Test the Improvements**

### Environment Validation
```bash
# Remove a required env var and try to start
rm .env
npm start
# Should show clear error message
```

### Form Validation
1. Go to "Register Business" page
2. Try submitting empty form - see validation errors
3. Enter invalid phone number - see real-time feedback
4. Upload large file - see file size error

### Loading States
1. Browse businesses - see skeleton loading
2. Click "View Business" - see loading overlay
3. Submit business form - see button loading state

### Error Handling
1. Disconnect internet while browsing
2. Try to load business details offline
3. Upload invalid file types
